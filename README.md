# MNIST-Classifier

Project for the Neural Networks chair, where we worked on parameter optimization of an MLP network developed by Michael Nielsen (https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35) based on the feedforward algorithm.

## Authors

To improve the accuracy rate (by 92.66% in the base project provided by Michael), we made changes to the number of epochs, minibatch_size and learning_rate parameters. To further analyze the training performance as well as the individual performance of each of the training classes, we have modified the 'network.py' file by inserting a plot function responsible for generating the overall performance and performance graphs by class.
